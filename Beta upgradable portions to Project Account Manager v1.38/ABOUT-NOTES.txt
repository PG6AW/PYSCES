Deep down the ocean, lived a creature;
The creature was called Pysces!
"Nothing comes without sacrifice" Said the creature itself! And what's this all about?

	Here is a tale of a future that never was, of a night that never dawned ...


		*** After long last, all the things i decided to add to my old project (not in a stable release, but in a so-called beta indeed), Account/Password manager, are as follows:

			+ Added a Captcha bot-detection system
			+ Added a random delaying-capability after every login or register attempt to prevent flood on network systems (Which might sound bothersome to some folks!)
			+ limited a selective range of special delimiter characters from being included in username syntax during registration process so that we can effectively forbid the use of irregular characters in usernames.
			+ UPGRADED TO OUR BETA VERSION! ENJOY :)
