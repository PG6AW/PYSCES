Deep down the ocean, lived a creature;
The creature was called Pysces!
"Nothing comes without sacrifice" Said the creature itself! And what's this all about?

	Here is a tale of a future that never was, of a night that never dawned ...


		*** After long last, all the things i decided to add to my old project (not in a stable release, but in a so-called beta indeed), Account/Password manager, are as follows:

			+ Limited some username character
			+ Somehow changed the looks of the Library to something more likeable
			+ Better and more enhanced Book and User registration in the "Registry.py"
			+ UPGRADED TO OUR BETA VERSION! ENJOY :)


	Please note that this is a beta version and not a stable release but you can replace the files of the stable release of the project on my github with the corresponding files included here in the beta version:
